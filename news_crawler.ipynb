As we scrape the articles, we save the main text in a pandas DataFrame. This allows us to later analyze each data entry and extract sentences containing the keywords relevant to our final project. It is important to note that the articles are sourced from news outlets known to be as reliable as possible and minimally biased, as determined by [Ad Fontes Media’s Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/).\n",
